## Business Understanding

### Project overview
A survey was conducted from August to November 2022, to assess the impact of music on people's mental health and mood in general. The survey recorded responses from over 700 participants and includes details like musical preferences, listening habits, and overall state of mind. Respondents were given 16 genres of music for which they ranked the frequency of listening to each. The responses ranged from never, to very frequently. Moreover, the respondents also ranked the intensity of their feelings of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD on a scale of 1 to 10. 0 being the lowest in intensity to 10 being the highest. Using data from the survey, this project aims to generate insights about the correlation between music genres and the different states of mental health of participants.

The participants with the lowest intensity of feelings of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD:
- Never listen to EDM, Folk, Hip hop, K pop, Lofi, Metal, Pop, R&B, Rap and Video game music genres.
- Rarely listen to Jazz, Latin and Rock genres.
- Sometimes listen to Country and Gospel music genres.
- Very frequently listen to Classical genres.

## Conclusions and recommendations
People with high levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD should spend more hours per day listening to music.

The music genre that should often be used during therapy sessions is Classical.

Other music genres that should be considered are Country and Gospel music genres.
